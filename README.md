# Steel Industry Energy Consumption

## Overview 
 
"Energy consumption in the steel industry is a critical factor affecting production costs and environmental impact. Efficient energy management is essential to minimize waste, reduce costs, and lower carbon emissions. However, predicting energy consumption accurately is challenging due to the influence of multiple factors such as production levels, machine efficiency, and operational parameters. Developing a reliable predictive model can help optimize energy usage and improve sustainability in the steel industry."
